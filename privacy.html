    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

      <strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 1, 2026 &nbsp;•&nbsp;
      <strong>Owner:</strong> Sandiver Publishing
    </p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how SalesExchange by Inside Sales Manager™ (the “Application”)
      collects, uses, and protects information when you access or use the Application.
      By using the Application, you agree to this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      You may provide CRM/business data that you choose to enter into the Application,
      such as contact information, notes, and pipeline data.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also collect limited technical and usage information to support and improve the Application,
      such as device/app version, logs, performance and crash reports, and general city/state location.
      We do not intentionally collect sensitive identifiers (for example, Social Security numbers,
      government ID numbers, or biometrics).
    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>
      We use information to: (a) provide and maintain the Application and CRM features;
      (b) analyze usage to improve the experience; (c) monitor performance and help prevent abuse;
      (d) communicate updates and provide support; and (e) comply with legal obligations.
      Sandiver Publishing does not sell User Data.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Analytics &amp; Service Providers</h2>
    <p>
      We may use trusted providers for analytics, error monitoring, hosting/database,
      and authentication/security. These providers process limited data on our behalf and are required
      to protect it.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Ownership</h2>
    <p>
      Users retain ownership of CRM/business data submitted to the Application. We claim no ownership
      of your User Data and process it only as needed to provide, maintain, and improve the Application.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Storage &amp; Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use reasonable safeguards (for example, secure cloud services, access controls, monitoring,
      and encryption in transit where applicable). However, no system is 100% secure.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain data while your account is active and as needed for legal, compliance, or dispute
      purposes. After termination, data may be deleted or anonymized within a commercially reasonable
      timeframe unless legally required.
    </p>

    <h2>7. User Rights &amp; Choices</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on your location, you may request access to or a copy of your data, corrections,
      or deletion (subject to legal requirements). You may also opt out of non-essential communications.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The Application is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect
      children’s personal information.
    </p>

    <h2>9. International Users</h2>
    <p>
      If you access the Application from outside the United States, you acknowledge that information
      may be processed or stored in the United States or other jurisdictions where our providers operate.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this policy and post updates within the Application or on our website.
      Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.
